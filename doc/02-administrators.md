# Administrators

Administration is relatively straight forward. This section will walk
you through installation and configuration.

## Installation

DCT is distributed as a standard DCS module. You can download the
[latest release](https://github.com/jtoppins/dct/releases/latest)
zip file and copy the `DCT` folder contained in the zip file to your
DCS saved games directory and place in;

	<dcs-saved-games>/Mods/tech

If the path does not exist just create it. If installed properly DCT
will be displayed as a module in the game's module manager.


## DCS Server Modification

DCT requires the DCS mission scripting environment to be modified, the
file needing to be changed can be found at
`$DCS_ROOT\\Scripts\\MissionScripting.lua.`
Comment out the removal of lfs and io and the setting of 'require' to nil.


## Configuration

Configuration is also relatively straight forward. DCT comes with a
limited amount of server side configuration, these configuration options
are described and listed below.

### File Location

DCT stores its server side configuration in a standard lua file located in:

	<dcs-saved-games>/Config/dct.cfg

The configuration file's syntax is the same as other DCS configuration files
the game uses so it should be familiar to an experienced DCS server
administrator.

A change to the configuration file will require the mission be restarted
before the settings take effect.

_Note: if you have multiple dedicated server saved game folders (referred to
a "write directory" in the DCS dedicated server documentation) you will need
a dct.cfg in each instance._

### Example Configuration File

The below is a valid example of the `dct.cfg` configuration file. Where
text in `<>` represent a variable instead of a constant.

	debug = false
	profile = false
	--statepath = "<dcs-saved-games>/<theater-name>_<sortie-name>.state"
	--theaterpath = "<dcs-temp-directory>/theater"
	schedfreq = 2
	tgtfps = 75
	percentTimeAllowed = .3
	period = -1
	logger = {}
	whitelists = {}
	statServerHostname = "localhost"
	statServerPort = 8095
	dctid = "changeme"

### Options

All DCT server configuration can be accessed via LUA's global table at:

	_G.dct.settings.server.<config-item>

Where `<config-item>` is the name of the configuration option below.

#### `debug`

 * _value:_ boolean (true/false)

Globally enable debug logging and debugging checks.

#### `profile`

 * _value:_ boolean (true/false)

Globally enable profiling. Can cause performance issues.

#### `statepath`

Defines where the statefile for the campaign will be stored.

 * _value:_ string
 * _default path:_ `<dcs-saved-games>/<name-of-theater>_<name-of-mission>.state`

Where `<name-of-theater>` is the name of the map the .miz mission file was
built for and `<name-of-mission>` is the "sortie" name given to the mission
when building the mission in the mission editor.

_Note: An adminstrator likely does not need to modify this from the default._

#### `theaterpath`

 * _value:_ string

Defines where the "theater definition" exists. See
[Campaign Designer](03-designer.md) documentation for what a
"theater definition" is.

_Note: A campaign designer likely will want to define this while building
their campaign._

#### `schedfreq`

 * _value:_ number in hertz
 * _default:_ 2 hertz

DCT has a central command scheduler on which everything is driven. A higher
number will mean both AI and player UI will be more responsive but at the
cost of lower server performance.

_Note: the default is likely a reasonable value._

#### `tgtfps`

 * _value:_ number in frames-per-second
 * _default:_ 75 fps

DCT has a central command scheduler on which everything is driven. This
scheduler implements a
[clamped game loop](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html)
which will prevent additional commands from executing once DCT's calculated
quanta has been reached. This allows the server to "catch-up". A lower
value will effectively allocate more time for DCT to run at the expense of
stealing server cycles for things like networking.

_Note: Caution sould be taken when changing this value._

#### `percentTimeAllowed`

 * _value:_ decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
 * _default:_ .3

Used in calculation of the quanta. Specifies the percent of time in a given
frame DCT is allowed to run.

	example:
	    percentTimeAllowed = .3
	    tgtfps = 75
	    quanta = (1/75)*.3 = 0.004 or 4 milliseconds
	      This means per-frame DCT is only allowed 4ms of execution time.

#### `logger.<subsystem>`

Defines the logging level for various subsystems in the framework. The
logging levels are:

 * `(0) error`
 * `(1) warn`
 * `(2) info`
 * `(4) debug`

The default level is the "warn" level.

`<subsystem>` can be one of the following:

 * `Theater`
 * `Command`
 * `Goal`
 * `Commander`
 * `Asset`
 * `AssetManager`
 * `Observable`
 * `Region`
 * `UI`

#### `period`

 * _value:_ time in seconds, -1 disables restart
 * _default:_ -1

The amount of time, in seconds, the server will be run before being
restarted by the dct-hooks script. This allows a server to periodically
restart its mission, this does not reset the saved state of the mission.

#### `whitelists`

 * _value:_ a two level table specifying whitelists for special role slots
 * _default:_ empty table

 An allow list can be defined for each special role slot allowing a server
 administrator to restrict the usage of these slots to specific people.

 A example of how to define a whitelist:

	whitelist = {
		["admin"] = {
			"ucid-1",
			"ucid-2",
		},
		["observer"] = {
			"ucid-3",
			"ucid-4",
		},
	}

Role specific slot types:

 * admin
 * forward_observer
 * instructor
 * artillery_commander
 * observer

If a UCID is a member of the "admin" role type these players can join any
slot on the server, assuming they have the DCS paid for content.

#### `statServerHostname`

 * _value:_ string, DNS server name or IPv4 address
 * _default:_ localhost

This address is used to send UDP data about the mission and its status
to a UDP server, generally a discord bot.

#### `statServerPort`

 * _value:_ number, UDP port number
 * _default:_ localhost

The port number on which a UDP server is listening to receive server data.

#### `dctid`

 * _value:_ string
 * _default:_ changeme

This is the ID by which this DCS server will be identified in UDP export
messages. This is used to differentiate different servers that use the
same UDP server to centralize the data.
